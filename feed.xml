<h2 id="article-ix-integration-by-parts--an-alternative-pattern-based-approach">Article IX: Integration by Parts – An Alternative, Pattern-Based Approach</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In our series Building Calculus from First Principles, we have built the foundations of calculus by focusing on algebraic patterns and finite differences. In this article, we present an alternative proof of the integration by parts formula. Instead of relying solely on the standard proof via the product rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus, we express the functions as power series in the infinitesimal increment and then rearrange the resulting sums. This approach highlights the telescoping nature of the sums and makes the pattern behind the integration by parts formula transparent.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-standard-integration-by-parts-formula">1. The Standard Integration by Parts Formula</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the alternative proof, recall the familiar integration by parts formula:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int u\, dv = uv - \int v\, du.
$$</div>

<p>This formula is traditionally derived from the product rule for differentiation:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(uv)' = u\,dv + v\,du.
$$</div>

<p>Integrating both sides over an interval $[a, b]$ and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus yields:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{a}^{b} u\,dv + \int_{a}^{b} v\,du = [uv]_{a}^{b},
$$</div>

<p>which can be rearranged to give:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{a}^{b} u\,dv = uv\Big|_{a}^{b} - \int_{a}^{b} v\,du.
$$</div>

<p>Taking limits (if needed) leads to the general formula. Our goal now is to provide an alternative, pattern-based derivation.</p>

<h2 id="2-alternative-proof-expressing-functions-as-series">2. Alternative Proof: Expressing Functions as Series</h2>

<h3 id="21-expanding-the-functions">2.1 Expanding the Functions</h3>

<p>Assume that we can expand a function $f(x)$ and another function $G(x)$ (with derivative $g(x) = G’(x)$) in a power series about a point $x$. Write:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x) &= A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + A_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n, \\
G(x + \Delta x) &= B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + B_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Since $f(x)$ and $G(x)$ are the values at $x$, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
A_0 = f(x) \quad \text{and} \quad B_0 = G(x).
$$</div>

<p>Moreover, because the derivative of $G$ is $g$, we have by definition:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
G(x + \Delta x) = G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x + \text{(higher order terms)}.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, we can write:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
G(x + \Delta x) = G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.
$$</div>

<h3 id="22-forming-the-product-and-its-difference">2.2 Forming the Product and Its Difference</h3>

<p>Consider the product $f(x) \, G(x)$ and how its change over an increment $\Delta x$ relates to the individual expansions. Our ultimate goal is to see how the differences lead to a telescoping pattern that recovers the integration by parts formula.</p>

<p>One way to approach this is to consider the difference of the product over the increment $\Delta x$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \bigl[f(x) G(x)\bigr] &= f(x + \Delta x) \, G(x + \Delta x) - f(x)\, G(x).
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Using our series expansions, we would obtain a long expression that contains terms of different orders in $\Delta x. Our aim is to isolate the linear terms (i.e. terms proportional to $\Delta x), because in the limit as $\Delta x \to 0, the higher order terms vanish.</p>

<p>For clarity, let’s denote by $f_{A_1}(x) = A_1$ and similarly for $G$ that $B_1 = g(x). Then, to first order in $\Delta x:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x) &\approx f(x) + f_{A_1}(x)\,\Delta x,\\[1mm]
G(x + \Delta x) &\approx G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Multiplying these approximations, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x)\,G(x + \Delta x) &\approx \Bigl[f(x) + f_{A_1}(x)\,\Delta x\Bigr] \Bigl[G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x\Bigr] \\
&= f(x)G(x) + \Bigl[f(x)g(x) + G(x)f_{A_1}(x)\Bigr]\Delta x + \text{(higher order terms)}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Thus, the increment in the product is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x + \Delta x)G(x + \Delta x) - f(x)G(x) \approx \Bigl[f(x)g(x) + G(x)f_{A_1}(x)\Bigr]\Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Now, if we consider the standard integration by parts formula, the expression we expect to see is of the form:</p>

<p><span class="kdmath">$\int f(x) \, g(x) \, dx = f(x) G(x) - \int G(x) \, f_{A_1}(x) \, dx.$</span>
Our expansion above gives us one piece, and the remainder must come from a careful reorganization of the summation. In our alternative proof approach, we write the integral as a limit of a sum and then group differences in a telescopic manner.</p>

<h3 id="23-rewriting-the-integral-as-a-sum">2.3 Rewriting the Integral as a Sum</h3>

<p>Recall that by definition, the integral is given by:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} f(i \cdot \Delta x) \, \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>If we apply this idea to the product $f(x)g(x)$ (or equivalently $f(x) G’(x)$), we write:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int f(x) \, g(x) \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} f(i\Delta x) \, g(i\Delta x) \, \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>One alternative strategy is to note that we can write the sum as a telescoping sum if we express $f$ in terms of its differences:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(i\Delta x) = \bigl[f(i\Delta x) - f((i-1)\Delta x)\bigr] + f((i-1)\Delta x).
$$</div>

<p>While the full expansion can become complex, the key idea is that if you express the differences as series (as we did earlier for the antiderivative) and then rearrange terms, you can identify groups that cancel telescopically. The surviving terms will involve $f$ and $G$ evaluated at the endpoints, yielding:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int f(x) \, g(x) \, dx = f(x) G(x) - \int G(x) \, f'(x) \, dx.
$$</div>

<p>This is the pattern-based alternative derivation of the integration by parts formula.</p>

<h2 id="3-a-step-by-step-outline-of-the-alternative-proof">3. A Step-by-Step Outline of the Alternative Proof</h2>

<p>Let’s summarize the process with more detailed intermediate steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Expand $f(x+\Delta x)$ and $G(x+\Delta x)$ in a Series:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x) &= A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + A_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n,\\[1mm]
G(x + \Delta x) &= B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + B_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Here, $A_0 = f(x)$ and $B_0 = G(x)$. Moreover, $B_1 = g(x)$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Express $G(x+\Delta x)$ in Terms of $G(x)$ and $g(x)$:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
G(x + \Delta x) = G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Form the Product $f(x+\Delta x) G(x+\Delta x)$:</li>
</ol>

<p>Multiply the series:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+\Delta x)G(x+\Delta x) &= \Bigl[A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots\Bigr] \\
&\quad \times \Bigl[B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots\Bigr].
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the Linear (First-Order) Term:</li>
</ol>

<p>The constant term is $A_0 B_0 = f(x) G(x). The first-order term in $\Delta x is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
A_0 B_1\,\Delta x + A_1 B_0\,\Delta x,
$$</div>

<p>which equals</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x) \, g(x) \, \Delta x + G(x) \, f'(x) \, \Delta x.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Relate the Sum of the Differences to the Integral:</li>
</ol>

<p>When you sum the differences over a partition and take the limit as $\Delta x \to 0, the higher-order terms vanish. The telescoping sum will then yield:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} \Bigl[f(x_{i+1})G(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)G(x_i)\Bigr] = f(N)G(N) - f(0)G(0).
$$</div>

<p>However, reorganizing the terms by grouping the differences for $f$ and $G$ separately leads to the rearranged form:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int f(x)\,g(x)\,dx = f(x)G(x) - \int G(x)\,f'(x)\,dx.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Conclusion:</li>
</ol>

<p>This manipulation shows that the incremental changes in the product $f(x)G(x)$ can be expressed as a telescoping series. In the limit, the sum of these differences equals the difference at the endpoints, thus yielding the integration by parts formula:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int u\, dv = uv - \int v\, du.}
$$</div>

<h2 id="4-final-remarks">4. Final Remarks</h2>

<p>This alternative proof, which is based on expanding the increments as power series and reorganizing the sum, reveals the hidden algebraic pattern behind integration by parts. Instead of simply applying the product rule, we see that every term in the expansion contributes to a telescoping sum that naturally cancels out the intermediate contributions, leaving only the endpoint evaluations and a residual term that corresponds to the second integral.</p>

<p>This method is particularly powerful because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It makes all the intermediate steps and patterns visible.</li>
  <li>It emphasizes that integration is the summation of infinitesimal changes.</li>
  <li>It provides an intuitive, first-principles foundation for the integration by parts formula.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="article-viii-difference-equations-for-the-anti-derivative">Article VIII: Difference Equations for the Anti-Derivative</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In our series Building Calculus from First Principles, we have focused on expressing functions as sums of infinitesimal contributions and revealing their underlying algebraic patterns. In this article, we turn our attention to the difference equations that connect a function with its antiderivative. Instead of relying solely on retrospectively analyzing known formulas, we compile a set of difference equations which, by “peeling off” the increments, reveal the pattern behind the antiderivative. Our method is entirely elementary and algebraic, emphasizing clear, step-by-step reasoning.</p>

<h2 id="1-difference-equations-for-powers">1. Difference Equations for Powers</h2>

<p>The core idea is to relate the differential expression $x^p\,dx$ to the difference between consecutive powers of $x$. For very small $dx$ (or in the limit as $dx$ becomes infinitesimal), we have the following difference equations:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
x\, dx &= \frac{(x + dx)^2 - x^2}{2},\\[1mm]
x^2\, dx &= \frac{(x + dx)^3 - x^3}{3},\\[1mm]
x^3\, dx &= \frac{(x + dx)^4 - x^4}{4},\\[1mm]
x^4\, dx &= \frac{(x + dx)^5 - x^5}{5}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>For the first equation:Expand $(x + dx)^2$:</li>
</ul>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x + dx)^2 = x^2 + 2x\,dx + (dx)^2.
$$</div>

<p>Neglecting the $(dx)^2$ term (since $dx$ is infinitesimally small), we obtain:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x + dx)^2 - x^2 \approx 2x\,dx.
$$</div>

<p>Dividing by 2 yields:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
x\,dx \approx \frac{(x + dx)^2 - x^2}{2}.
$$</div>

<ul>
  <li>For the second equation:Similarly, expand $(x+dx)^3$:</li>
</ul>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x+dx)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\,dx + 3x\,(dx)^2 + (dx)^3.
$$</div>

<p>Ignoring the higher-order terms, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x+dx)^3 - x^3 \approx 3x^2\,dx,
$$</div>

<p>so that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
x^2\,dx \approx \frac{(x+dx)^3 - x^3}{3}.
$$</div>

<ul>
  <li>The subsequent equations follow the same idea.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-adjusting-the-difference-equations-for-a-finite-increment-delta-x">2. Adjusting the Difference Equations for a Finite Increment $\Delta X$</h2>

<p>If instead of an infinitesimal $dx$ we have a finite increment $\Delta X$, the exact equations include higher-order terms. For example, using the binomial expansion we obtain:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
x\,\Delta X + \frac{(\Delta X)^2}{2} &= \frac{(x + \Delta X)^2 - x^2}{2}, \\[1mm]
x^2\,\Delta X + x\,(\Delta X)^2 + \frac{(\Delta X)^3}{3} &= \frac{(x + \Delta X)^3 - x^3}{3}, \\[1mm]
x^3\,\Delta X + \frac{3x^2\,(\Delta X)^2}{2} + x\,(\Delta X)^3 + \frac{(\Delta X)^4}{2} &= \frac{(x + \Delta X)^4 - x^4}{4}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<h3 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In the first equation, the full expansion is:</li>
</ul>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x + \Delta X)^2 = x^2 + 2x\,\Delta X + (\Delta X)^2.
$$</div>

<p>Hence,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{(x + \Delta X)^2 - x^2}{2} = \frac{2x\,\Delta X + (\Delta X)^2}{2} = x\,\Delta X + \frac{(\Delta X)^2}{2}.
$$</div>

<ul>
  <li>The higher equations are obtained by applying the binomial theorem to $(x + \Delta X)^k$ and then subtracting $x^k$.</li>
</ul>

<p>These equations illustrate how, when the increment is not infinitesimally small, additional terms appear to account for the full change.</p>

<h2 id="3-application-deriving-the-antiderivative-of-cosx">3. Application: Deriving the Antiderivative of $\cos(x)$</h2>

<p>Let us now see how these difference equations connect with integration.</p>

<h3 id="31-integration-of-cosx">3.1 Integration of $\cos(x)$</h3>

<p>We aim to show:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int \cos(x) \, dx = \sin(x) + C.
$$</div>

<p>Step 1. Express the Increment in $\sin(x)$From the sine addition formula,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sin(x + \Delta x) = \sin(x)\cos(\Delta x) + \cos(x)\sin(\Delta x).
$$</div>

<p>For very small $\Delta x$, we use the approximations:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\cos(\Delta x) \approx 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin(\Delta x) \approx \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Thus,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sin(x + \Delta x) \approx \sin(x) + \cos(x) \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Subtract $\sin(x)$ from both sides:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sin(x + \Delta x) - \sin(x) \approx \cos(x)\Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Step 2. Forming the Telescoping SumDivide the interval $[0, \pi]$ into subintervals of width $\Delta x$. Then</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{\pi} \cos(x)\, dx \approx \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} \cos(i\Delta x) \, \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>But as we just observed, for each subinterval the change in $\sin(x)$ is approximately:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sin((i+1)\Delta x) - \sin(i\Delta x) \approx \cos(i\Delta x)\Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, the sum becomes:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} \left[\sin((i+1)\Delta x) - \sin(i\Delta x)\right].
$$</div>

<p>This is a telescoping series; almost every term cancels:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sin(\Delta x) - \sin(0) + \sin(2\Delta x) - \sin(\Delta x) + \cdots + \sin(N) - \sin(N-\Delta x) = \sin(N) - \sin(0).
$$</div>

<p>Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0, we deduce:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{\pi} \cos(x)\, dx = \sin(\pi) - \sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0.
$$</div>

<p>(For the general antiderivative, one obtains $\int \cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x) + C$.)</p>

<h2 id="4-application-deriving-the-antiderivative-of-sinx">4. Application: Deriving the Antiderivative of $\sin(x)$</h2>

<p>Similarly, consider:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int \sin(x)\, dx.
$$</div>

<p>Step 1. Express the Increment in $\cos(x)$Recall the cosine addition formula:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\cos(x + \Delta x) = \cos(x)\cos(\Delta x) - \sin(x)\sin(\Delta x).
$$</div>

<p>For small $\Delta x$, this approximates to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\cos(x + \Delta x) \approx \cos(x) - \sin(x)\Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Rearrange to obtain:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\cos(x) - \cos(x + \Delta x) \approx \sin(x)\Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Thus,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sin(x)\Delta x \approx \cos(x) - \cos(x+\Delta x).
$$</div>

<p>Step 2. Telescoping SumDivide the interval and sum:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n/\Delta x} \left[\cos(i\Delta x) - \cos((i+1)\Delta x)\right]
$$</div>

<p>telescopes to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\cos(0) - \cos(n\Delta x).
$$</div>

<p>Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0 (and adjusting for the proper interval), we deduce:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int \sin(x)\, dx = -\cos(x) + C.
$$</div>

<h2 id="5-application-deriving-the-antiderivative-of-frac1x">5. Application: Deriving the Antiderivative of $\frac{1}{x}$</h2>

<p>Using the logarithm, note the following expansion from previous work:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\log(x+h) &= \log(x) + \log\!\Bigl( \Bigl(1+\frac{h}{x}\Bigr)^{\frac{x}{h}} \Bigr)^{\frac{h}{x}} \\
&= \log(x) + \log\!\Bigl(e^{\frac{h}{x}}\Bigr) \\
&= \log(x) + \frac{h}{x}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Thus,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{h}{x} = \log(x+h) - \log(x).
$$</div>

<p>When you sum these differences over an interval, the telescoping nature gives:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln|x| + C.
$$</div>

<h2 id="6-integration-by-parts-a-brief-mention">6. Integration by Parts (A Brief Mention)</h2>

<p>An additional powerful tool is integration by parts, which can also be derived using difference equations. For example, if we write the expansion for functions $f(x)$ and $G(x)$ (with $G’(x) = g(x)$) as:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+\Delta x) &= A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots, \\
G(x+\Delta x) &= B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots,
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>then the product $f(x)G(x)$ has a difference that telescopes. The careful grouping of terms ultimately leads to the familiar integration by parts formula:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du.}
$$</div>

<h2 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have examined how difference equations can be used to “reverse-engineer” antiderivatives by considering the differences between successive values of a function. By writing:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
x\,dx &= \frac{(x+dx)^2 - x^2}{2},\\[1mm]
x^2\,dx &= \frac{(x+dx)^3 - x^3}{3},\\[1mm]
x^3\,dx &= \frac{(x+dx)^4 - x^4}{4},\\[1mm]
x^4\,dx &= \frac{(x+dx)^5 - x^5}{5},
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>we see a clear pattern: the differential (or the infinitesimal change) times a power of $x$ equals the difference of two successive higher powers of $x, divided by a constant.</p>

<p>By summing these differences over a partition, we obtain telescoping sums that yield the net change in the antiderivative. This process provides a natural and intuitive derivation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, as well as alternative derivations for integration formulas (for $\cos(x)$, $\sin(x)$, $\frac{1}{x}$, and even integration by parts).</p>

<p>This approach emphasizes the importance of algebraic patterns and finite differences, reinforcing the idea that integration is simply the accumulation of infinitesimal changes. By understanding and working through these difference equations step by step, one gains a deeper insight into the structure of antiderivatives and the fundamental connections between discrete sums and continuous change.</p>

<h2 id="part-vii--fundamental-theorem-of-calculus">Part VII: # Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h2>

<p>In this article, we establish a fundamental relationship: if $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<p>We shall derive this result from first principles by interpreting integration as the summing of infinitely many infinitesimal contributions and then using the definition of the derivative in a telescoping sum.</p>

<h2 id="1-main-proof">1. Main Proof</h2>

<p>We begin by defining the integral as the limit of a sum. Let $\Delta x$ be an infinitely small increment and suppose that the interval $[0, N]$ is divided into subintervals of width $\Delta x$ so that the number of subintervals is $N/\Delta x$. Then the integral is defined by</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} f(i \cdot \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Assume that $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$; that is, $F’(x)=f(x)$. Then we may rewrite the sum by replacing $f(x)$ with $F’(x)$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} F'(i \cdot \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Now, using the definition of the derivative for each term, we have</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F'(i \cdot \Delta x) = \frac{F(i \cdot \Delta x + \Delta x) - F(i \cdot \Delta x)}{\Delta x}.
$$</div>

<p>Substitute this back into the sum:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} \frac{F(i \cdot \Delta x + \Delta x) - F(i \cdot \Delta x)}{\Delta x} \cdot \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Notice that the factor $\Delta x$ in the numerator and denominator cancels:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} \Bigl[F(i \cdot \Delta x + \Delta x) - F(i \cdot \Delta x)\Bigr].
$$</div>

<p>Observe that this sum is telescoping. Writing out a few terms:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
&\Bigl[F(\Delta x) - F(0)\Bigr] \;+\; \Bigl[F(2\Delta x) - F(\Delta x)\Bigr] \;+\; \Bigl[F(3\Delta x) - F(2\Delta x)\Bigr] \;+\; \cdots \\
&\quad +\; \Bigl[F(N) - F(N-\Delta x)\Bigr].
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Most of the terms cancel, leaving:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Bigl[F(N) - F(0)\Bigr] = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<p>Thus, we have proved that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = F(N) - F(0).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="2-alternative-proof-by-telescoping-differences">2. Alternative Proof by Telescoping Differences</h2>

<p>An alternative proof uses the idea of examining the differences between successive increments of the function $F$.</p>

<p>Consider the differences:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
F(x + \Delta x) - F(x) &= f_{A_1} \, \Delta x + f_{A_3} \, (\Delta x)^2 + f_{A_4} \, (\Delta x)^3 + \ldots, \\
F(x + 2\Delta x) - F(x + \Delta x) &= f_{A_1} (2\Delta x) + f_{A_3} (2\Delta x)^2 + f_{A_4} (2\Delta x)^3 + \ldots, \\
F(x + 3\Delta x) - F(x + 2\Delta x) &= f_{A_1} (3\Delta x) + f_{A_3} (3\Delta x)^2 + f_{A_4} (3\Delta x)^3 + \ldots, \\
&\;\vdots \\
F(x + N\Delta x) - F(x + (N-1)\Delta x) &= f_{A_1} (N\Delta x) + f_{A_3} (N\Delta x)^2 + f_{A_4} (N\Delta x)^3 + \ldots.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>If we sum these differences vertically, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x -1} \Bigl[F(x+(i+1)\Delta x) - F(x+i\Delta x)\Bigr].
$$</div>

<p>This sum telescopes:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x+\Delta x) - F(x) + F(x+2\Delta x) - F(x+\Delta x) + \cdots + F(x+N\Delta x) - F(x+(N-1)\Delta x) = F(x+N\Delta x) - F(x).
$$</div>

<p>Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ (and noting $x+N\Delta x \to N$ if we set $x=0$ for simplicity), we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \bigl[F(N) - F(0)\bigr] = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<p>Thus, we recover the fundamental relationship:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = F(N) - F(0).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="3-concluding-remarks">3. Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>Both proofs illustrate the same underlying idea: integration is the summation of infinitely many infinitesimally small contributions. By expressing the integral as a limit of sums and then re-writing the summand using the definition of the derivative, we obtain a telescoping sum. The telescoping nature of the sum naturally leads to the result $F(N)-F(0)$.</p>

<p>This foundational result—the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus—shows the deep connection between differentiation and integration, establishing that the accumulation of infinitesimal changes (integration) recovers the net change in a function (difference of the antiderivative).</p>

<p>End of Article</p>

<p>This article presents a natural, intuitive, and algebraic proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, incorporating all of your rough work while ensuring clarity and completeness. It avoids advanced terminology and focuses solely on the algebraic structure of the limit of sums, making the foundational ideas accessible.</p>

<p>o3-mini-high</p>

<p>Below is an extended, “dumbed-down” explanation that shows every intermediate step between forming the sum of differences over the partition and recognizing its telescoping nature. This version is intended to help you visualize the pattern clearly.</p>

<h3 id="detailed-steps-in-the-telescoping-sum">Detailed Steps in the Telescoping Sum</h3>

<p>Assume we have a continuously differentiable function $F(x)$ with derivative $F’(x) = f(x)$. We partition the interval $[0, N]$ into $M$ subintervals of equal width $h$ so that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
x_i = 0 + i\,h, \quad \text{for } i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, M,
$$</div>

<p>with</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
M\,h = N.
$$</div>

<p>For each subinterval, the change in $F$ is given by:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i).
$$</div>

<p>Step 1. Writing the Sum of the Differences</p>

<p>We form the sum over all subintervals:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr].
$$</div>

<p>Let’s write this out term by term:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{For } i=0:&\quad F(x_1) - F(x_0), \\
\text{For } i=1:&\quad F(x_2) - F(x_1), \\
\text{For } i=2:&\quad F(x_3) - F(x_2), \\
&\quad \vdots \\
\text{For } i=M-1:&\quad F(x_M) - F(x_{M-1}).
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Thus, the entire sum is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr]
&= \Bigl[F(x_1) - F(x_0)\Bigr] \\
&\quad + \Bigl[F(x_2) - F(x_1)\Bigr] \\
&\quad + \Bigl[F(x_3) - F(x_2)\Bigr] \\
&\quad + \cdots \\
&\quad + \Bigl[F(x_M) - F(x_{M-1})\Bigr].
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Step 2. Observing the Telescoping Pattern</p>

<p>Now, write the sum out in full, showing the plus and minus signs:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Sum} =\; &F(x_1) \quad - \; F(x_0) \\
&+ \; F(x_2) \quad - \; F(x_1) \\
&+ \; F(x_3) \quad - \; F(x_2) \\
&\quad \vdots \\
&+ \; F(x_M) \quad - \; F(x_{M-1}).
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Notice what happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$F(x_1)$ appears first as $+F(x_1)$ and then as $-F(x_1)$. They cancel.</li>
  <li>Similarly, $F(x_2)$ appears as $+F(x_2)$ and then $-F(x_2)$, canceling each other.</li>
  <li>This cancellation continues for all intermediate terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, all terms cancel except for the very first negative term and the very last positive term:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\text{Sum} = F(x_M) - F(x_0).
$$</div>

<p>Since $x_0 = 0$ and $x_M = N$, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr] = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<p>Step 3. Taking the Limit</p>

<p>In our definition of integration, we let the width $h$ approach 0 (and thus $M \to \infty$):</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{h\to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr].
$$</div>

<p>Since the telescoping sum is exactly $F(N) - F(0)$ regardless of the number of subintervals, the limit is simply:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<h2 id="3-alternate-view-expressing-each-difference-as-a-series">3. Alternate View: Expressing Each Difference as a Series</h2>

<p>For a more detailed look at the pattern, suppose that we express the change over each subinterval as a power series in $h$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x_i + h) - F(x_i) = f_{A_1}(x_i) \, h + f_{A_2}(x_i) \, h^2 + f_{A_3}(x_i) \, h^3 + \cdots.
$$</div>

<p>Then the sum over all subintervals is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr] = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[ f_{A_1}(x_i) \, h + f_{A_2}(x_i) \, h^2 + f_{A_3}(x_i) \, h^3 + \cdots \Bigr].
$$</div>

<p>When $h$ is very small, the dominant contribution comes from the first-order term:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} f_{A_1}(x_i) \, h.
$$</div>

<p>In the limit $h \to 0$, this sum converges to the integral:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} f(x_i) \, h = \int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx,
$$</div>

<p>since $f_{A_1}(x_i) = F’(x_i) = f(x_i).</p>

<p>The higher-order terms vanish in the limit, and the telescoping structure (shown above) ensures that the entire sum equals $F(N) - F(0)$.</p>

<p>ChatGPTReasoned for a couple of secondsBelow is an expanded version of the “Alternate View” section that explains, step by step, how to express each difference as a power series and then sum these differences to reveal the telescoping pattern. This detailed explanation is intended to make the process completely clear and intuitive.</p>

<h2 id="alternate-view-expressing-each-difference-as-a-series">Alternate View: Expressing Each Difference as a Series</h2>

<h3 id="1-expressing-the-incremental-change-as-a-series">1. Expressing the Incremental Change as a Series</h3>

<p>Suppose $F(x)$ is a function that is differentiable (and, in fact, can be expanded in a power series) on the interval of interest. For a small increment $h$, we can write the change in $F$ over a single subinterval starting at $x_i$ as a power series in $h$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x_i + h) - F(x_i) = f_{A_1}(x_i) \, h + f_{A_2}(x_i) \, h^2 + f_{A_3}(x_i) \, h^3 + \cdots,
$$</div>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$f_{A_1}(x_i)$ is the coefficient of the linear term, which equals $F’(x_i)$;</li>
  <li>$f_{A_2}(x_i)$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term, related to $\frac{F’‘(x_i)}{2!}$;</li>
  <li>$f_{A_3}(x_i)$ is the coefficient of the cubic term, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>For simplicity, we denote the series as:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x_i + h) - F(x_i) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f_{A_m}(x_i) \, h^m.
$$</div>

<h3 id="2-forming-the-total-sum-over-the-partition">2. Forming the Total Sum over the Partition</h3>

<p>Assume we partition the interval $[0, N]$ into $M$ subintervals of equal width $h$, so that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
x_0 = 0,\quad x_1 = h,\quad x_2 = 2h,\quad \dots,\quad x_{M} = N,
$$</div>

<p>with $M \cdot h = N$.</p>

<p>For each subinterval $[x_i,\, x_{i+1}]$ the change in $F$ is given by:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f_{A_m}(x_i) \, h^m.
$$</div>

<p>Now, form the sum of these differences over all subintervals:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr] = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \left[ \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f_{A_m}(x_i) \, h^m \right].
$$</div>

<h3 id="3-interchanging-the-order-of-summation">3. Interchanging the Order of Summation</h3>

<p>Since the sum is finite in $i$ (from $0$ to $M-1$) and we assume that the series in $h$ converges uniformly for sufficiently small $h$, we can interchange the order of summation:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \left[ \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f_{A_m}(x_i) \, h^m \right] = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left[ \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} f_{A_m}(x_i) \right] h^m.
$$</div>

<p>In this expression:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inner sum $\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} f_{A_m}(x_i)$ collects the coefficients of $h^m$ from each subinterval.</li>
  <li>The outer sum then reassembles the entire contribution in powers of $h$.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-observing-the-telescoping-behavior">4. Observing the Telescoping Behavior</h3>

<p>Let’s consider the effect of summing the first-order terms (i.e., $m=1$):</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\text{First-order contribution: } \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} f_{A_1}(x_i) \, h.
$$</div>

<p>Since $f_{A_1}(x_i) = F’(x_i)$, and in the limit $h \to 0$ the sum approximates the integral of $F’(x)$ over $[0, N]$, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} F'(x_i) \, h = \int_{0}^{N} F'(x) \, dx.
$$</div>

<p>However, the beauty of the telescoping sum lies in how the differences add up directly without needing to integrate term by term. Write out the sum explicitly:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \Bigl[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\Bigr] &= \bigl[F(x_1) - F(x_0)\bigr] + \bigl[F(x_2) - F(x_1)\bigr] \\
&\quad + \bigl[F(x_3) - F(x_2)\bigr] + \cdots + \bigl[F(x_M) - F(x_{M-1})\bigr].
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Notice the cancellation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$F(x_1)$ appears positively in the first term and negatively in the second.</li>
  <li>$F(x_2)$ appears in the second term and cancels with the third, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the entire sum simplifies to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
F(x_M) - F(x_0) = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<h3 id="5-taking-the-limit-and-concluding">5. Taking the Limit and Concluding</h3>

<p>When we let $h \to 0$ (i.e., $M \to \infty$ with $M\,h = N$), the higher-order terms in $h$ vanish, and we obtain exactly:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{h\to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \left[F(x_{i+1}) - F(x_i)\right] = F(N) - F(0).
$$</div>

<p>Thus, we have derived the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = F(N) - F(0).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="7--conclusion">7.  Conclusion</h2>

<p>By partitioning the interval and expressing the change in $F(x)$ over a small increment $h$ as a power series, we observe a clear telescoping pattern when we sum these differences. The intermediate terms cancel, leaving only the difference between the final and initial values, $F(N) - F(0)$. Therefore, we arrive at the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in its simplest form:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = F(N) - F(0).}
$$</div>

<p>This approach, which relies solely on algebraic manipulations and limits, provides an intuitive and transparent derivation. By focusing on the visible pattern of cancellation in the telescoping sum, the connection between the derivative and the antiderivative becomes clear.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>We wish to understand the structure of the sum</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
S_p(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^p,
$$</div>

<p>which is known to be a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. A key ingredient in deriving the general formula is the binomial identity:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} n^j.
$$</div>

<p>In this discussion, we will explore the basics of the binomial theorem, derive this identity step by step, and explain how it helps us “build” the general formula by revealing the patterns in the sums.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-binomial-theorem-basics">2. The Binomial Theorem: Basics</h2>

<p>The Binomial Theorem states that for any nonnegative integer $m$ and any numbers $a$ and $b$,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(a+b)^m = \sum_{j=0}^{m} \binom{m}{j} a^{m-j}b^j,
$$</div>

<p>where the binomial coefficient is defined as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\binom{m}{j} = \frac{m!}{j!(m-j)!}.
$$</div>

<p>A particularly simple case is obtained by setting $a = n$ and $b = 1$. Then,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^m = \sum_{j=0}^{m} \binom{m}{j} n^j.
$$</div>

<p>In our case, we will choose $m = p+1$, so that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p+1} \binom{p+1}{j} n^j.
$$</div>

<h2 id="3-deriving-the-key-binomial-identity">3. Deriving the Key Binomial Identity</h2>

<p>We are interested in the difference:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1}.
$$</div>

<p>Using the binomial theorem, we write:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p+1} \binom{p+1}{j} n^j.
$$</div>

<p>Now, notice that the term corresponding to $j = p+1$ is</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\binom{p+1}{p+1} n^{p+1} = n^{p+1}.
$$</div>

<p>Subtracting $n^{p+1}$ cancels that term:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p+1} \binom{p+1}{j} n^j - n^{p+1}.
$$</div>

<p>Since the $j = p+1$ term is exactly $n^{p+1}$, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} n^j.
$$</div>

(n+1)^{p+1} = \binom{p+1}{0}n^{p+1} + \binom{p+1}{1} n^{p} + \binom{p+1}{2} n^{p-1} + \cdots + \binom{p+1}{p} n + \binom{p+1}{p+1}.

(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \binom{p+1}{1}n^p + \binom{p+1}{2}n^{p-1} + \cdots + \binom{p+1}{p}n + 1.
$$</div>

<p>Here, we re-index by letting $j = 0$ represent the constant term, $j=1$ represent the term with $n$, and so on. That is,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} n^{j},
$$</div>

<p>where we understand that $\binom{p+1}{0} = 1$.</p>

<p>Thus, the identity is established.</p>

<h3 id="41-setting-up-the-recurrence">4.1 Setting Up the Recurrence</h3>

<p>The identity</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} n^{j}
$$</div>

<p>is powerful because it expresses the incremental change in $(n+1)^{p+1}$ in terms of lower powers of $n$.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
S_p(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^p
$$</div>

<p>is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
S_p(n) = a_{p,0} + a_{p,1}\,n + a_{p,2}\,n^2 + \cdots + a_{p,p+1}\,n^{p+1}.
$$</div>

<p>Since $S_p(0)=0$, we have $a_{p,0} = 0$.</p>

<h3 id="42-telescoping-via-summation">4.2 Telescoping via Summation</h3>

<p>We can sum the identity for consecutive values of $n$. Consider:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
S_p(n+1) - S_p(n) = (n+1)^p.
$$</div>

<p>If we sum both sides from $n=0$ to $N-1$, the left-hand side telescopes:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \Bigl[S_p(n+1) - S_p(n)\Bigr] = S_p(N) - S_p(0) = S_p(N).
$$</div>

<p>On the right-hand side, using the binomial identity, we have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (n+1)^p.
$$</div>

<p>Alternatively, if we sum the identity</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} n^{j}
$$</div>

<p>from $n=0$ to $N-1$, the left-hand side telescopes to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
N^{p+1} - 0^{p+1} = N^{p+1}.
$$</div>

<p>The right-hand side becomes:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{j} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} S_j(N-1).
$$</div>

<p>This yields a recurrence that expresses $N^{p+1}$ (a known polynomial) in terms of the sums $S_j$ for $j \le p$. If you already know $S_0, S_1, \dots, S_{p-1}$, you can solve for $S_p(N-1)$.</p>

<h3 id="43-directly-observing-the-pattern">4.3 Directly Observing the Pattern</h3>

<p>A key insight is that the left-hand side, $(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1}$, when expanded, contains only powers of $n$ up to $n^p$. Therefore, if we compare the coefficients on both sides (after writing $S_p(n)$ as a polynomial), we obtain a system of equations relating the coefficients $a_{p,k}$ to binomial coefficients. In particular, one finds that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{k=j+1}^{p+1} a_{p,k}\,\binom{k}{j} = \binom{p}{j}, \quad \text{for } j=0,1,\dots,p.
$$</div>

<p>This system allows you to solve for the coefficients $a_{p,k}$ one by one. Notably, the highest coefficient comes out to be:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
a_{p,p+1} = \frac{1}{p+1},
$$</div>

<p>which is consistent with the observation that the leading term of the polynomial is $\frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}$ (as one would expect from the integral of $x^p$). The lower-order coefficients are determined by the binomial coefficients and display a symmetry that is both combinatorial and elegant.</p>

<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>The binomial identity</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(n+1)^{p+1} - n^{p+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p+1}{j} n^{j}
$$</div>

<p>provides a powerful and intuitive way to derive the general formula for sums of powers. By summing over $n$ and changing the order of summation, we obtain a recurrence relation that expresses $S_p(n)$ in terms of lower-order sums. This approach not only confirms that $S_p(n)$ is a polynomial of degree $p+1$ with leading coefficient $\frac{1}{p+1}$ but also reveals that the other coefficients are determined by binomial coefficients.</p>

<p>This method is both natural and intuitive because it builds on the familiar binomial theorem and the telescoping property of finite differences. Once you grasp this approach, you can derive the general formula (Faulhaber’s formula) systematically, and you gain deep insight into the combinatorial structure underlying these sums.</p>

<h2 id="part-vi-integration-from-first-principles">Part VI: Integration from First Principles</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In our earlier parts of the series, we showed how functions could be expanded into series and how algebraic patterns in these expansions reveal the rules of differentiation. In this article we turn our attention to integration—understood as the process of summing an infinite collection of infinitesimally small contributions. Here, integration is defined from first principles using a limit process that captures the cumulative effect of these contributions. We will illustrate this by computing the integrals of simple functions such as the constant function, $x$, and $x^2$, using elementary summation techniques.</p>

<h3 id="1-a-foundational-definition-of-integration">1. A Foundational Definition of Integration</h3>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be a function defined on an interval, and consider dividing the interval into a large number of subintervals of equal width $\Delta x$. If we let</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
N = \frac{n}{\Delta x},
$$</div>

<p>then we define the integral of $f(x)$ over a suitable interval as the limit of a sum of the form</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x)\, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} f(i\, \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>In our approach, we interpret this definition as the exact summing of infinitely many small contributions from $f(x)$. (For our purposes, we avoid the usual technical terms and focus on the algebraic structure of the sum.)</p>

<h3 id="2-integration-examples">2. Integration Examples</h3>

<p>2.1 Integration of the Constant FunctionConsider the constant function:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x) = 1.
$$</div>

<p>Then the cumulative sum over the interval (from 0 to $x$) is</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{x} 1 \, dx &= \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} 1 \cdot \Delta x \\
&= \left(\frac{n}{\Delta x}\right) \Delta x \\
&= x.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Thus, we obtain</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int 1 \, dx = x + C.}
$$</div>

<p>2.2 Integration of $x$Now, consider:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x) = x.
$$</div>

<p>We form the sum</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{x} x \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} \Bigl(i\, \Delta x\Bigr) \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Recall the well-known summation formula for the first $N$ natural numbers:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N} i = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}.
$$</div>

<p>Interpreting $N = \frac{n}{\Delta x}$, we have</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} i = \frac{\frac{n}{\Delta x}\left(\frac{n}{\Delta x} + 1\right)}{2}.
$$</div>

<p>Multiplying by $(\Delta x)^2$ (since each term is multiplied by $\Delta x$ from the summation), we obtain</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{x} x \, dx &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[ \frac{\frac{n}{\Delta x}\left(\frac{n}{\Delta x} + 1\right)}{2} \cdot (\Delta x)^2 \right] \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[ \frac{n^2}{2\Delta x^2} (\Delta x)^2 + \frac{n}{2\Delta x} (\Delta x)^2 \right] \\
&= \frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n\,\Delta x}{2}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Since $n\,\Delta x = x$ and in the limit $\Delta x \to 0$ the second term vanishes, we deduce that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} x^2 + C.}
$$</div>

<p>2.3 Integration of $x^2$Next, consider:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x) = x^2.
$$</div>

<p>We express the sum as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\int_{0}^{x} x^2 \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{\frac{n}{\Delta x}} \Bigl(i\, \Delta x\Bigr)^2 \Delta x.
$$</div>

<p>Recall the formula for the sum of the squares of the first $N$ natural numbers:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N} i^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}.
$$</div>

<p>Substitute $N = \frac{n}{\Delta x}$ and multiply by $(\Delta x)^3$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{x} x^2 \, dx &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \left[ \frac{\frac{n}{\Delta x}\left(\frac{n}{\Delta x}+1\right)\left(2\frac{n}{\Delta x}+1\right)}{6} \cdot (\Delta x)^3 \right] \\
&= \frac{n^3}{3},
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>since the lower order terms vanish as $\Delta x$ becomes infinitely small, and noting that $n\,\Delta x = x$. Thus, we conclude that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C.}
$$</div>

<p>Note: In these derivations, standard summation formulas for $\sum i$ and $\sum i^2$ are used to reveal the pattern. This method of “summing contributions” from infinitesimally small intervals is the cornerstone of our integration approach from first principles.</p>

<h3 id="3-summary-of-the-method">3. Summary of the Method</h3>

<p>In each example, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Divide the interval into many subintervals of width $\Delta x$.</li>
  <li>Sum the contributions $f(i\,\Delta x) \cdot \Delta x$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$.</li>
  <li>Use known formulas for the sums of integers and their powers.</li>
  <li>Take the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ to obtain an exact expression for the integral.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach illustrates that integration is the process of summing infinitely many infinitesimal contributions, and that the antiderivative of a function emerges naturally from these summation patterns.</p>

<h3 id="4-pedagogical-insights-and-benefits">4. Pedagogical Insights and Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clear Algebraic Patterns:By writing the integration process as a limit of sums and then using standard summation formulas, the underlying algebraic structure becomes evident. Students can see how the expressions for $\int 1\,dx$, $\int x\,dx$, and $\int x^2\,dx$ arise from basic arithmetic patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elementary Foundation:This method uses only elementary algebra and limits, providing a very accessible entry point to the concept of integration. It avoids technical terminology and focuses on visible patterns, which can be especially beneficial for beginners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unified Perspective:Integration, seen in this light, is not an abstract or isolated concept; it is simply the inverse process of differentiation. The same idea of “peeling off” contributions is used in both integration and differentiation, offering a unified perspective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preparation for Advanced Topics:Understanding integration from this foundational standpoint prepares students to later tackle more sophisticated techniques and to appreciate the logical structure of calculus.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h3>

<p>We have defined integration from first principles as the summing of infinitely many infinitesimal contributions, and we demonstrated this by explicitly deriving the antiderivatives for the constant function, $x$, and $x^2$. In each case, we employed the idea of partitioning the interval and summing contributions over each subinterval, using standard summation formulas to reveal the final algebraic expressions.</p>

<p>Thus, we conclude:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\displaystyle \int 1\,dx = x + C$,</li>
  <li>$\displaystyle \int x\,dx = \frac{1}{2} x^2 + C$,</li>
  <li>$\displaystyle \int x^2\,dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C$.</li>
</ul>

<p>This integration approach, based on recognizing and summing algebraic patterns, provides a fresh, intuitive entry point to calculus—building from first principles and reinforcing the deep connection between differentiation and integration.</p>

<h2 id="part-v-2-properties-with-division-involved">Part V-2: Properties with Division Involved</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In Part V-1, we derived the generalized expansion for functions of the form</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by} = \frac{1}{by} - \frac{ax}{b^2y^2} + \frac{a^2x^2}{b^3y^3} - \frac{a^3x^3}{b^4y^4} + \cdots,
$$</div>

<p>which was obtained using elementary algebra, long division, and the geometric series expansion. In this installment, we use similar elementary, algebraic methods to derive several differentiation formulas that involve division. By examining the power series and “peeling off” the coefficients (i.e. matching the terms in the series), we will derive formulas for the derivatives of functions such as $\sec(x)$, $\csc(x)$, $\tan(x)$, and $\log(x)$. Our focus is on the visible algebraic patterns without invoking geometric notions.</p>

<h2 id="1-derivative-of-secx">1. Derivative of $\sec(x)$</h2>

<h3 id="statement">Statement</h3>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x) \tan(x).
$$</div>

<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>

<p>We start with:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{align*}
\sec(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\cos(x + h)} \\
\because \cos(x + h) &= \cos(x)\cos(h) - \sin(x)\sin(h) \\
\therefore\quad \sec(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\cos(x)\cos(h) - \sin(x)\sin(h)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)\, h} \quad \text{(for small } h\text{)}.
\end{align*}
$$</div>

<p>We then expand $\frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x) h}$ as a series in $h$. Observing the pattern, one can see that this series has a ratio of</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{-\sin(x)h}{\cos(x)},
$$</div>

<p>so that the linear (first-order) term in $h$ is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{-\sin(x)h}{\cos^2(x)}.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, by our pattern-based approach, the derivative is determined by this coefficient, and we obtain:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x) \tan(x).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="2-chain-rule-example-using-division">2. Chain Rule Example Using Division</h2>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>Let</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \frac{1}{x}, \\
g(x) &= \cos(x).
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>We wish to find the expansion of the composite function $f(g(x+h))$.</p>

<h3 id="proof-idea">Proof Idea</h3>

<p>Consider the expansion for $\sec(x+h)$ (which is $1/\cos(x+h)$) again:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{align*}
\sec(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\cos(x + h)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x) h} \quad \text{(for small } h\text{)}.
\end{align*}
$$</div>

<p>When we expand $f(g(x+h))$, the idea is that the incremental change in the composite function can be interpreted as the product of the incremental change of the inner function $g(x)$ and the derivative of the outer function $f$ evaluated at $g(x)$. In other words, the first-order term in the expansion of $f(g(x+h))$ is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \, h.
$$</div>

<p>This is exactly the chain rule:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="3-derivative-of-cscx">3. Derivative of $\csc(x)$</h2>

<h3 id="statement-1">Statement</h3>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x) \cot(x).
$$</div>

<h3 id="proof-1">Proof</h3>

<p>We start with:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{align*}
\csc(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\sin(x + h)} \\
\because \sin(x + h) &= \sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h) \\
\therefore\quad \csc(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\sin(x) + \cos(x)h} \quad \text{(for small } h\text{)}.
\end{align*}
$$</div>

<p>Here, the expansion of $\frac{1}{\sin(x) + \cos(x)h}$ reveals that the ratio of the linear term in $h$ is approximately:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{-\cos(x)h}{\sin^2(x)}.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, the coefficient of $h$ in the expansion (which determines the derivative) leads to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x) \cot(x).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="4-derivative-of-tanx">4. Derivative of $\tan(x)$</h2>

<h3 id="statement-2">Statement</h3>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x).
$$</div>

<h3 id="proof-2">Proof</h3>

<p>We have:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{align*}
\tan(x+h) &= \frac{\sin(x+h)}{\cos(x+h)}.
\end{align*}
$$</div>

<p>Using the approximations for small $h$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(x+h) &\approx \sin(x) + \cos(x)h,\\[1mm]
\cos(x+h) &\approx \cos(x) - \sin(x)h,
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>we write:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\tan(x+h) \approx \frac{\sin(x) + \cos(x)h}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)h}.
$$</div>

<p>This can be expressed as:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\tan(x+h) = [\sin(x) + \cos(x)h] \cdot \frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)h}.
$$</div>

<p>Now, expand the reciprocal:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)h} = C_0 + C_1 h + \ldots,
$$</div>

<p>where we define:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
C_0 &= \frac{1}{\cos(x)}, \\[1mm]
C_1 &= \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Multiplying out, the constant term of the product gives $\sin(x)C_0$ and the first-order term in $h$ will involve:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
C_0 \cos(x) + C_1 \sin(x).
$$</div>

<p>Substitute the values:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
C_0 \cos(x) + C_1 \sin(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\cos(x)} + \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)} \sin(x) = 1 + \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}.
$$</div>

<p>Recognize that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x).
$$</div>

<p>Thus,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x).}
$$</div>

<h2 id="5-derivative-of-logx">5. Derivative of $\log(x)$</h2>

<h3 id="statement-3">Statement</h3>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\log(x)] = \frac{1}{x}.
$$</div>

<h3 id="proof-3">Proof</h3>

<p>We expand $\log(x+h)$ as follows:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{align*}
\log(x + h) &= \log\Bigl(x\Bigl(1 + \frac{h}{x}\Bigr)\Bigr) \\
&= \log(x) + \log\Bigl(1 + \frac{h}{x}\Bigr) \\
&\approx \log(x) + \frac{h}{x},
\end{align*}
$$</div>

<p>where we have used the elementary approximation:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\log(1+\varepsilon) \approx \varepsilon \quad \text{for small } \varepsilon.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, the coefficient of $h$ is $\frac{1}{x}$, which implies:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\log(x)] = \frac{1}{x}.}
$$</div>

<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we have extended our first-principles, pattern-based approach to derive several differentiation formulas for functions involving division. By examining the series expansions—using elementary methods such as long division and geometric series—we obtained:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\,x^{-1} = -x^{-2}$.</li>
  <li>$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x)\tan(x)$.</li>
  <li>$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x)\cot(x)$.</li>
  <li>$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x)$.</li>
  <li>$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\log(x)] = \frac{1}{x}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each result is reached by identifying the coefficient of the first-order term in the series expansion of the function when its argument is incremented by a small $h$. This approach reinforces that the standard differentiation formulas are natural consequences of the algebraic structure of power series.</p>

<h2 id="7-final-remarks">7. Final Remarks</h2>

<p>This article has illustrated the power and elegance of an algebraic, pattern-based approach to calculus. By relying solely on elementary techniques, we have demonstrated that many familiar rules of differentiation emerge naturally from series expansions. This method not only provides a rigorous entry point to calculus from first principles but also offers a unified and intuitive way to view the underlying structure of mathematical functions.</p>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In the previous articles of this series, we built the foundations of calculus by examining how functions behave under infinitesimal changes. We avoided geometric interpretations and instead focused on recognizing algebraic patterns in function expansions.</p>

<p>Now, we extend our exploration to division properties and infinite series expansions, which will naturally lead to differentiation formulas for reciprocal functions and more complex expressions. Instead of memorizing derivatives, we emphasize pattern recognition and how the rules emerge algebraically.</p>

<p>In this part, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand long division as a method for expanding functions,</li>
  <li>Derive the series expansion for $\frac{1}{x+h}$,</li>
  <li>Use infinite series representations to extend this to general division-based functions,</li>
  <li>Derive the derivatives of $\sec(x)$, $\csc(x)$, $\tan(x)$, and $\log(x)$,</li>
  <li>Showcase how patterns in algebra naturally reveal differentiation rules.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="11-expanding-frac1xh-using-long-division">1.1 Expanding $\frac{1}{x+h}$ Using Long Division</h3>

<p>Consider the reciprocal function:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x + h) = \frac{1}{x+h}.
$$</div>

<p>Our goal is to express this in a form that reveals the coefficient of $h$ clearly, leading to its derivative. Long division is a powerful tool here.</p>

<p>If you need a refresher on long division, let’s first illustrate it with an algebraic example:</p>

<h3 id="12-long-division-example-fracx4---4x--2">1.2 Long Division Example: $\frac{x^4 - 4}{x + 2}$</h3>

<p>Performing the division step by step:</p>

$$</div>

<p>The step-by-step breakdown is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
x^4 - 1 = (x + 2)(x^3) - 2x^3 - 1.
$$</div>

<p>Expanding further:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x + 2)(x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 8) - 15.

<h1 id="a-generalized-expansion-for-frac1axby">A Generalized Expansion for $\frac{1}{ax+by}$</h1>

<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>

<p>In many applications, it is useful to express functions in the form of an infinite series. One important example is the reciprocal function. In our approach we have already seen that elementary functions like</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{1+x}
$$</div>

<p>can be expressed as an infinite geometric series. Here, we extend this idea to a more generalized expression,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by},
$$</div>

<p>where $a$ and $b$ are constants, and $x$ and $y$ are variables. Our goal is to derive an infinite series representation for $\frac{1}{ax+by}$ by elementary means—using long division and geometric series techniques—and to highlight the algebraic patterns that emerge.</p>

<h3 id="2-setting-up-the-expression">2. Setting Up the Expression</h3>

<p>We begin with the function</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by}.
$$</div>

  </tbody>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by} = \frac{1}{by} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{ax}{by}}.

<p>Here, the term $\frac{ax}{by}$ will serve as our “small” parameter.</p>

<h3 id="3-applying-the-geometric-series-expansion">3. Applying the Geometric Series Expansion</h3>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{1+t} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n t^n.
$$</div>

<p>Setting</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
t = \frac{ax}{by},
$$</div>

<p>we have</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{1+\frac{ax}{by}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \left(\frac{ax}{by}\right)^n.
$$</div>

<p>Multiplying this series by the prefactor $\frac{1}{by}$, we obtain:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by} = \frac{1}{by} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \left(\frac{ax}{by}\right)^n.
$$</div>

<p>Rearranging, the series becomes:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{a^n}{b^{n+1}} \, \frac{x^n}{y^{n+1}}.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, the final series expansion is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{ax+by} = \frac{1}{by} - \frac{ax}{b^2y^2} + \frac{a^2x^2}{b^3y^3} - \frac{a^3x^3}{b^4y^4} + \cdots,}
$$</div>

<p>with the convergence condition:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\left|\frac{ax}{by}\right| < 1.
$$</div>

<h3 id="4-discussion-of-the-pattern">4. Discussion of the Pattern</h3>

<p>Let us examine the structure of the series carefully:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Overall Factor:The series begins with the factor $\frac{1}{by}$, which is the “zeroth-order” term corresponding to the constant part of the denominator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternating Signs:Each term is multiplied by $(-1)^n$, indicating that the signs alternate. This is a hallmark of the geometric series expansion for $\frac{1}{1+t}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Powers of $x$ and $y$:The $n$th term involves $x^n$ in the numerator and $y^{n+1}$ in the denominator. Additionally, the constants $a$ and $b$ appear in the form $a^n$ and $b^{n+1}$, respectively. This shows that as $n$ increases, higher powers of $x$ and lower powers of $y$ (relative to the constant $b$) come into play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General Term:The general term is:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
T_n = (-1)^n \frac{a^n}{b^{n+1}} \, \frac{x^n}{y^{n+1}}.
$$</div>

<p>This pattern is consistent for all $n \ge 0$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convergence Condition:The series converges provided:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\left|\frac{ax}{by}\right| < 1,
$$</div>

<p>which controls the relative sizes of $x$ and $y$ (and the constants $a$ and $b$).</p>

<h3 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h3>

<p>We have derived the generalized infinite series expansion for the function</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{ax+by}
$$</div>

<p>using elementary methods. The final expansion is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{ax+by} = \frac{1}{by} - \frac{ax}{b^2y^2} + \frac{a^2x^2}{b^3y^3} - \frac{a^3x^3}{b^4y^4} + \cdots, \quad \text{for } \left|\frac{ax}{by}\right| < 1.}
$$</div>

<p>This expansion not only provides a valuable tool for approximating functions but also reveals a beautiful algebraic pattern: each term in the series corresponds to a higher power of the small parameter $\frac{ax}{by}$, and the series is an instance of an infinite geometric series. Recognizing these patterns reinforces the idea that many standard results in calculus—especially those involving division and infinite series—emerge naturally from basic algebraic manipulations.</p>

<h2 id="part-iv-division-properties-and-infinite-series">Part IV: Division Properties and Infinite Series</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In our previous articles, we developed an elementary, algebraic approach to express functions as sums of contributions from different orders of an infinitely small increment. We saw that by “peeling off” the constant term, then the coefficient of $\Delta x$, then that of $(\Delta x)^2$, etc., we arrive naturally at the familiar Taylor series expansion.</p>

<p>In this installment, we extend that approach to functions involving division. We will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop a series expansion for reciprocal functions such as $\frac{1}{x+h}$ using the method of long division.</li>
  <li>Derive important differentiation formulas (for example, for $x^{-1}$) from these series.</li>
  <li>Present infinite series formulas for functions like $\frac{1}{1+x}$ in both the standard geometric and Laurent forms.</li>
  <li>Show how algebraic manipulation in series leads naturally to product and chain rules when division is involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our aim is to give the reader a clear, pattern-based entry into these topics—revealing the algebraic structure underlying many fundamental formulas in calculus.</p>

<h2 id="1-division-properties-and-infinite-series">1. Division Properties and Infinite Series</h2>

<p>Let us begin by considering the derivative of a reciprocal function:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{d}{dx}\,x^{-1}.
$$</div>

<p>To understand this from first principles, we wish to expand</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x+h) = \frac{1}{x+h}
$$</div>

<p>into a power series in $h$ (or $\Delta x$) so that we can identify the coefficient of $h$.</p>

<h3 id="11-using-long-division">1.1 Using Long Division</h3>

<p>To bring the expression into a form where the coefficient of $h$ is visible, we employ the Long Division method. If you have forgotten the process of long division, here is a brief revision:</p>

<p>Long Division RevisionTo perform the long division for, say,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{x^4 - 4}{x + 2},
$$</div>

<p>follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Divide the first term of the numerator ($x^4$) by the first term of the denominator ($x$); this gives $x^3$.</li>
  <li>Multiply the entire denominator ($x + 2$) by $x^3$ and subtract the result from the numerator.</li>
  <li>Bring down the next term and repeat until all terms are used.</li>
</ol>

<p>An example of a long division layout in LaTeX is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
& x^3 & -2x^2 & +4x & -8 \\ 
\hline
x + 2 & x^4 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 
& x^4 & +2x^3 & & \\ 
\hline
& & -2x^3 & & -1 \\ 
& & -2x^3 & -4x^2 & \\ 
\hline
& & & 4x^2 & -1 \\ 
& & & 4x^2 & +8x \\ 
\hline
& & & & -8x - 1 \\ 
& & & & -8x - 16 \\ 
\hline
& & & & 15 \\ 
\end{array}
$$</div>

<p>A step-by-step breakdown for dividing $x^4 - 1$ by $x + 2$ is given by:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
x^4 - 1 & = (x + 2)(x^3) - 2x^3 - 1 \\ 
& = (x + 2)(x^3) - (x + 2)(2x^2) + 4x^2 - 1 \\ 
& = (x + 2)(x^3) - (x + 2)(2x^2) + (x + 2)(4x) - 8x - 1 \\ 
& = (x + 2)(x^3) - (x + 2)(2x^2) + (x + 2)(4x) - (x + 2)(8) - 15 \\ 
& = (x + 2)(x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 8) - 15.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>This serves as a review for performing long division on polynomials.</p>

<h2 id="2-series-expansion-for-frac1xh-via-long-division">2. Series Expansion for $\frac{1}{x+h}$ via Long Division</h2>

<p>We now apply the long division technique to derive the series expansion for the function</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{x+h}.
$$</div>

<p>Begin with the expression:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{x+h}.
$$</div>

<p>The idea is to rewrite and expand the expression into a series of the form:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{x+h} = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{h}{x^2} + \frac{h^2}{x^3} - \frac{h^3}{x^4} + \ldots.
$$</div>

<p>The derivation follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rewriting the Expression:</li>
</ol>

<p>Write $\frac{1}{x+h}$ as an expression in powers of $h$. One way to proceed is to factor out $x$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{x+h} = \frac{1}{x\left(1 + \frac{h}{x}\right)} = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{h}{x}}.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Expanding as a Geometric Series:</li>
</ol>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>For $\left</td>
      <td>\frac{h}{x}\right</td>
      <td>&lt; 1$, the expression</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{1 + \frac{h}{x}}
$$</div>

<p>can be expanded as a geometric series:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{1 + \frac{h}{x}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{h}{x}\right)^n.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Writing the Final Series:</li>
</ol>

<p>Multiplying by $\frac{1}{x}$ gives:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{x+h} = \frac{1}{x} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{h}{x}\right)^n = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{h}{x^2} + \frac{h^2}{x^3} - \frac{h^3}{x^4} + \cdots.
$$</div>

<p>Notice that the general term in the series is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{(-1)^n h^n}{x^{n+1}}.
$$</div>

<p>Thus, we have derived the series expansion for $\frac{1}{x+h}$.</p>

<h3 id="21-deriving-the-derivative-of-x-1">2.1 Deriving the Derivative of $x^{-1}$</h3>

<p>The series expansion for $\frac{1}{x+h}$ is:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{1}{x+h} = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{h}{x^2} + \frac{h^2}{x^3} - \frac{h^3}{x^4} + \cdots.
$$</div>

<p>The coefficient of the first-order term $h$ in this expansion is $-\frac{1}{x^2}$. Hence, by our first-principles method, we conclude that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(x^{-1}\right) = -\frac{1}{x^2}.

<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we have extended our first-principles approach to include division properties and infinite series. By using the method of long division and series expansion, we derived the expansion for $\frac{1}{x+h}$ and demonstrated how the coefficients in this series yield the derivative of $x^{-1}$ (namely, $-x^{-2}$). We further explored how infinite series formulas, such as those for $\frac{1}{1+x}$, naturally arise from these ideas. Finally, we showed that the algebraic patterns in these series lead directly to standard differentiation formulas for functions like $\sec(x)$, $\tan(x)$, and $\log(x)$.</p>

<p>This pattern-based, algebraic approach provides a clear and elementary entry point to calculus, emphasizing that the fundamental rules of differentiation are built into the very structure of the series expansions. By exposing these patterns, we offer both a new perspective for learners and a rigorous foundation from which more advanced topics can later be developed.</p>

<h2 id="part-iii-lhôpitals-rule-via-pattern-recognition">Part III: L’Hôpital’s Rule via Pattern Recognition</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In our series “Building Calculus from First Principles,” we have explored how functions can be expressed as series in powers of an infinitesimally small increment, and how the familiar formulas for differentiation emerge from the algebraic pattern of these series. In this installment, we turn our attention to L’Hôpital’s Rule. Our goal is to show—using only elementary algebra and limit operations—that when the limit of a quotient results in an indeterminate form (like $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$), one may “peel off” the lowest-order contributions in the series expansions of the numerator and denominator. This leads directly to the rule that the limit of the original quotient equals the limit of the quotient of the derivatives. Throughout, we focus on the visible pattern in the algebraic manipulations rather than any geometric intuition.</p>

<h3 id="1-statement-of-lhôpitals-rule">1. Statement of L’Hôpital’s Rule</h3>

<p>L’Hôpital’s Rule (Informal Statement):Suppose that for functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ (which are differentiable near $x=a$, except possibly at $a$) the limit</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}
$$</div>

<p>results in an indeterminate form $0/0$ or $\infty/\infty$. Then, under suitable conditions,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.
$$</div>

<p>Our aim is to derive this result by considering the algebraic patterns in the Taylor series (or power series) expansions of $f$ and $g$ around $x=a$.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-pattern-based-proof">2. The Pattern-Based Proof</h3>

<p>Let $h = x - a$. Then, for sufficiently small $h$, assume that the functions $f$ and $g$ can be expanded in powers of $h$:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= f(a+h) = f(a) + f'(a) h + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}h^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}h^3 + \cdots, \\
g(x) &= g(a+h) = g(a) + g'(a) h + \frac{g''(a)}{2!}h^2 + \frac{g^{(3)}(a)}{3!}h^3 + \cdots.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Because we are dealing with an indeterminate form, we assume that $f(a) = 0$ and $g(a) = 0$ (the proof for the $\infty/\infty$ case is analogous). With these assumptions, the expansions simplify to:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(a+h) &= f'(a) h + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}h^2 + \cdots, \\
g(a+h) &= g'(a) h + \frac{g''(a)}{2!}h^2 + \cdots.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Step 1. Form the QuotientThe quotient is</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{f(a+h)}{g(a+h)} = \frac{f'(a) h + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}h^2 + \cdots}{g'(a) h + \frac{g''(a)}{2!}h^2 + \cdots}.
$$</div>

<p>Step 2. Divide by the Common Factor $h$Both the numerator and denominator have $h$ as a common factor. Factor out $h$ from each:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{f(a+h)}{g(a+h)} = \frac{h\left[f'(a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}h + \cdots\right]}{h\left[g'(a) + \frac{g''(a)}{2!}h + \cdots\right]}.
$$</div>

<p>Cancel the common factor $h$ (for $h\neq 0$):</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{f(a+h)}{g(a+h)} = \frac{f'(a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}h + \cdots}{g'(a) + \frac{g''(a)}{2!}h + \cdots}.
$$</div>

<p>Step 3. Take the Limit as $h\to 0$As $h$ approaches $0$, every term containing a positive power of $h$ becomes negligible compared to the constant terms. Hence,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h)}{g(a+h)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}.
$$</div>

<p>Since $h = x - a$, this is equivalent to</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}.
$$</div>

<p>Step 4. Generalization of the PatternThe algebraic manipulation shows that the first nonzero term in the expansion (the order of $h$) dominates the behavior of the quotient as $h \to 0$. The pattern is clear: when both functions vanish at $a$, their leading-order behavior is given by the coefficients of $h$ in their power series. This is precisely why we can replace the quotient of the functions by the quotient of their first-order coefficients, which are $f’(a)$ and $g’(a)$ respectively.</p>

<p>Thus, we have established that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.}
$$</div>

<p>This completes the algebraic, pattern-based proof of L’Hôpital’s Rule for the indeterminate form $0/0$.</p>

<h3 id="3-pedagogical-benefits-of-this-approach">3. Pedagogical Benefits of This Approach</h3>

<p>This method of proving L’Hôpital’s Rule by examining the algebraic patterns in the series expansions has several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Visible Patterns:The approach makes the role of each term in the expansion clear. By “peeling off” the $h$ factors, students can directly see that the leading-order term in the numerator and denominator determines the behavior of the limit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foundational Clarity:Rather than introducing L’Hôpital’s Rule as an isolated trick, this method shows that it is a natural consequence of the structure of the power series expansions—highlighting the deep connection between series and limits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency with First Principles:This presentation remains entirely within the realm of elementary algebra and limits, avoiding any reliance on advanced or geometric interpretations. It reinforces the idea that fundamental calculus concepts can be built from simple, visible patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Natural Entry Point:For students who have embraced the “building calculus from first principles” philosophy, this approach provides a seamless transition from the derivation of the Taylor series to the derivation of L’Hôpital’s Rule, underscoring the unity of the subject.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-conclusion">4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this article, we have derived L’Hôpital’s Rule by comparing the power series expansions of two functions that form an indeterminate quotient. By factoring out the common infinitesimal factor and observing the pattern in the coefficients, we demonstrated that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}.
$$</div>

<p>This algebraic, pattern-based method provides an alternative entry point to the concept of L’Hôpital’s Rule, one that reinforces the idea of “orders of infinitesimals” as the foundation of calculus.</p>

<p>By focusing on the visible algebraic structure of the series, this approach not only makes the proof accessible and intuitive but also illustrates how fundamental differentiation rules emerge naturally from first principles.</p>

<h3 id="up-next">Up Next</h3>
<p>Now that we understand L’Hôpital’s Rule through patterns, let’s explore division properties and infinite series in Part IV. We’ll see how these concepts naturally extend our understanding of calculus.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii-algebraic-patterns-in-differentiation-formulas">Part II: Algebraic Patterns in Differentiation Formulas</h2>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>In the first installment of this series, we showed that by representing a function with an infinitesimally small increment as</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x+\Delta x) = A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots,
$$</div>

<p>and by “peeling off” the contributions term‐by‐term, we discovered that</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
A_0 = f(x),\quad A_1 = f'(x),\quad A_2 = \frac{f''(x)}{2!},\quad \dots,
$$</div>

<p>which yields the Taylor series expansion. In this article, we continue our journey by exploring how algebraic patterns in series expansions lead naturally to the differentiation formulas for products and compositions of functions. Our approach remains entirely elementary and algebraic; we refrain from invoking geometric notions such as slopes or rates of change. Instead, we focus on seeing and understanding the patterns that arise when we manipulate these series.</p>

<h3 id="1-simple-algebraic-expansions">1. Simple Algebraic Expansions</h3>

<p>To build our intuition, consider the following familiar expansions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Square:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x+\Delta x)^2 = x^2 + 2x\,\Delta x + (\Delta x)^2.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Cube:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x+\Delta x)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\,\Delta x + 3x\,(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta x)^3.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Fourth Power:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x+\Delta x)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3\,\Delta x + 6x^2\,(\Delta x)^2 + 4x\,(\Delta x)^3 + (\Delta x)^4.
$$</div>

<ol>
  <li>Fifth Power:</li>
</ol>

<div class="kdmath">$$
(x+\Delta x)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4\,\Delta x + 10x^3\,(\Delta x)^2 + 10x^2\,(\Delta x)^3 + 5x\,(\Delta x)^4 + (\Delta x)^5.
$$</div>

<p>These formulas display a clear pattern: each expansion is composed of terms of increasing order in $\Delta x$. Our method in this series is to “read off” these patterns and use them to derive differentiation formulas.</p>

<h3 id="2-insights-for-differentiation-formulas">2. Insights for Differentiation Formulas</h3>

<p>Recall from our previous article that the coefficient of $\Delta x$ in the expansion of $f(x+\Delta x)$ is obtained by subtracting $f(x)$ and dividing by $\Delta x$; in the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ this coefficient becomes $f’(x)$. In other words, the algebraic pattern we see in the expansion is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The constant term (order $0$) is $f(x)$.</li>
  <li>The coefficient of $\Delta x$ (first order) is $f’(x)$.</li>
  <li>The coefficient of $(\Delta x)^2$ (second order) is $\frac{f’‘(x)}{2!}$.</li>
  <li>And so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal now is to apply this pattern to derive the multiplication rule and the chain rule.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-multiplication-rule-for-differentiation">3. The Multiplication Rule for Differentiation</h3>

<p>Consider two functions $f$ and $g$. Suppose that for a small increment $h$ we have their series expansions:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+h) &= A_0 + A_1\,h + A_2\,h^2 + A_3\,h^3 + \cdots,\\[1mm]
g(x+h) &= B_0 + B_1\,h + B_2\,h^2 + B_3\,h^3 + \cdots,
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>where, by our earlier results,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
A_0 = f(x),\quad A_1 = f'(x),\quad \ldots \quad \text{and} \quad B_0 = g(x),\quad B_1 = g'(x),\quad \ldots
$$</div>

<p>When we multiply these two series, the product becomes:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+h)\,g(x+h) &= (A_0 + A_1\,h + A_2\,h^2 + \cdots)(B_0 + B_1\,h + B_2\,h^2 + \cdots)\\[1mm]
&= A_0B_0\\[1mm]
&\quad + h\,(A_0B_1 + A_1B_0)\\[1mm]
&\quad + h^2\,(A_0B_2 + A_1B_1 + A_2B_0)\\[1mm]
&\quad + h^3\,(A_0B_3 + A_1B_2 + A_2B_1 + A_3B_0) + \cdots.
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Focusing on the coefficient of $h$ (the first-order term), we see it is</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
A_0B_1 + A_1B_0.
$$</div>

<p>Substituting the known identities, this becomes</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x)\,g'(x) + f'(x)\,g(x).
$$</div>

<p>Thus, by recognizing the algebraic pattern in the product series, we recover the multiplication rule for differentiation:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x).}
$$</div>

<h3 id="4-the-chain-rule-for-differentiation">4. The Chain Rule for Differentiation</h3>

<p>One of the most powerful and important rules in calculus is the chain rule. We’ll develop it here using our series expansion approach, showing how it emerges naturally from algebraic patterns.</p>

<h4 id="41-understanding-the-challenge">4.1 Understanding the Challenge</h4>

<p>When we compose two functions - that is, when we apply one function to the output of another - we need to understand how their derivatives interact. Our series expansion method will reveal this relationship through careful algebraic manipulation.</p>

<h4 id="42-setting-up-the-problem">4.2 Setting Up the Problem</h4>

<p>Let’s start with two functions expressed in their series forms. We want to see what happens when we compose them:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(x + h)  = A_0 + A_1 h + A_2 h^2 + A_3 h^3 + A_4 h^4 + A_5 h^5 + A_6 h^6 + \ldots
$$</div>

<div class="kdmath">$$
g(x + h) = B_0 + B_1 h + B_2 h^2 + B_3 h^3 + B_4 h^4 + B_5 h^5 + B_6 h^6 + \ldots
$$</div>

<h4 id="43-building-intuition-through-simple-cases">4.3 Building Intuition Through Simple Cases</h4>

<p>Before tackling the general case, let’s build our understanding through simpler scenarios. This step-by-step approach will help us see the emerging patterns more clearly.</p>

<h5 id="case-1-linear-inner-function">Case 1: Linear Inner Function</h5>
<p>First, consider what happens when g(x) only has a linear term in its expansion. This simplest case will give us our first glimpse of the pattern:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
g(x + h) = B_0 + h = g(x) + h
$$</div>

<p>Let say,</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(g(x) + h) =  C_0 + C_1 h + C_2 h^2 + C_3 h^3 + C_4 h^4 + C_5 h^5 + C_6 h^6 + \ldots
$$</div>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(g(x+h))= f(B_0 + h) =  f(g(x)+h)  =  C_0 + C_1 h + C_2 h^2 + C_3 h^3 + C_4 h^4 + C_5 h^5 + C_6 h^6 + \ldots
$$</div>

<h5 id="case-2-two-term-inner-function">Case 2: Two-Term Inner Function</h5>
<p>Next, we’ll see what happens when g(x) has both constant and linear terms. This reveals more of the general pattern:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
g(x + h) = B_0 + B_1 h  = f(g(x) + B_1 h)
$$</div>

<div class="kdmath">$$
f(g(x+h))= f(B_0 + B_1 h) = f(g(x) + B_1 h)  =  C_0 + C_1 B_1 h + C_2 B_1^2 h^2 + C_3 B_1^3 h^3 + C_4 B_1^4 h^4 + C_5 B_1^5 h^5 + C_6 B_1^6 h^6 + \ldots
$$</div>

<p>We can notice the coefficient of h gives us $\frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = f’(g(x)) \cdot g’(x)$</p>

<h4 id="44-the-general-case-full-proof">4.4 The General Case: Full Proof</h4>

<p>Now that we’ve built some intuition, let’s tackle the complete proof. We’ll see how the pattern we observed in simpler cases extends to the general situation:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}

<p>We can see from these equations that the coefficients of $h^0, h^1 , h^2, …$ are</p>

\text{Coff}(f(g(x+h)),h^0) &= C_0 \\
\text{Coff}(f(g(x+h)),h^1) &= B_1 C_1 \\
\text{Coff}(f(g(x+h)),h^2) &= B_2 C_1 +  B_1 C_2 \\

\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>Well the coefficient of h gives us $\frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = f’(g(x)) \cdot g’(x)$</p>

<h4 id="45-understanding-what-we-found">4.5 Understanding What We Found</h4>

<p>The algebraic manipulation reveals something remarkable: when we look at the coefficient of h in our final expansion, it’s exactly the product of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The derivative of the outer function (evaluated at the inner function’s value)</li>
  <li>The derivative of the inner function</li>
</ul>

<p>This is precisely the chain rule! The pattern shows us that:</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
$$</div>

<p>Our algebraic approach has revealed this fundamental relationship without relying on geometric intuition or rates of change.</p>

<p>$\frac{d}{dx}\cos(x^2)$</p>

<p>here ,</p>

<p>$f(x)= \cos(x)$ and $g(x) = x^2$</p>

<p>Now, $g(x+h) = (x^2 + 2 x h +  h^2)$</p>

<p>here we can see $f(g(x+h))$ is not lucky enough like $f(x+h)$ to have $+h$ in function which we know expansion of but looking closer it has $+h$ but with some multiplier from $(1)$</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\begin{aligned}

f(g(x+h)) &= f(B_0 + B_1 h + B_2 h^2 + \ldots ) \\\\

\cos(x + \Delta x) &= \cos(x)\cos(\Delta x) - \sin(x)\sin(\Delta x) \approx \cos(x) - \sin(x) \Delta x \\

\therefore \, \cos(x^2 + 2x h +  h^2) &=  \cos(x^2) - \sin(x^2)\Delta x \\

                                      &= \cos(x^2) - \sin(x^2)(2x h +  h^2)
\end{aligned}
$$</div>

<p>from this expansion it is evident that $\frac{d}{dx}\cos(x^2) = - \sin(x^2)(2x)$</p>

<h3 id="6-pedagogical-benefits-of-the-pattern-based-approach">6. Pedagogical Benefits of the Pattern-Based Approach</h3>

<p>This algebraic, pattern-focused method for developing differentiation formulas offers several advantages as an entry point to calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clarity Through Patterns:By “peeling off” the series term-by-term, students can see very clearly how each term corresponds to a higher order of the infinitesimally small quantity. The pattern $A_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}$ becomes self-evident through elementary algebra.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foundation for Differentiation Rules:The multiplication and chain rules emerge naturally from the algebraic manipulation of series. Rather than memorizing rules, students observe that these rules are simply consequences of the underlying patterns in the series expansions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Fresh Entry Point:This approach serves as an alternative starting point for calculus. Instead of beginning with limits and geometric interpretations, the focus is on algebraic patterns—making the subject accessible from a first-principles perspective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency and Rigor:Although the presentation is elementary, the method is entirely rigorous when the appropriate limit operations are performed. It reinforces that the standard differentiation formulas are not arbitrary but are built into the very structure of functions expressed as power series.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Motivation for Further Study:Once students see the natural emergence of these patterns, they are better prepared to understand more advanced topics. The method provides a strong conceptual foundation that can be built upon in courses on analysis, differential equations, and beyond.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this article, we extended our first-principles approach by exploring the algebraic patterns that lead to differentiation formulas for products and compositions of functions. We showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The multiplication of two series produces a pattern where the coefficient of the first-order term is $f(x)g’(x) + f’(x)g(x)$.</li>
  <li>The composition of functions, when expanded in series, reveals that the coefficient of the first-order term is $f’(g(x)) \cdot g’(x)$.</li>
</ul>

<p>These results—obtained by matching the coefficients of like powers of $h$ or $\Delta x$—demonstrate the multiplication and chain rules in an entirely algebraic and elementary fashion.</p>

<p>This approach not only offers a clear, pattern-based entry point to calculus but also reinforces the idea that the structure of differentiation formulas is inherent in the algebra of infinitesimally small increments. It serves as a foundation that deepens understanding and prepares students for more advanced studies in mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="up-next">Up Next</h3>
<p>Ready to dive deeper? In Part III, we’ll explore L’Hôpital’s Rule from a pattern-based perspective. We’ll see how the same series expansion techniques we used here can elegantly explain what happens when we have an indeterminate form like 0/0.</p>
