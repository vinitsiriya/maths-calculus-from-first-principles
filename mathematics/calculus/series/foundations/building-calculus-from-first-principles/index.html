<meta name="description" content="Building Calculus from First Principles Preface In many traditional calculus courses, topics such as limits, derivatives, and integrals are introduced in a sequence that often postpones the discussion of series expansions (and, in particular, the Taylor series) until later. In contrast, the approach presented here starts at the very beginning by considering the effect of an infinitesimally small change in the input on the output of a function. Our goal is to demonstrate, through purely algebraic manipulations and limit processes, that a function can be decomposed into contributions of successive orders of smallness. By “peeling off” the contributions term‐by‐term, we uncover a clear and visible pattern that leads directly to the standard Taylor series expansion. This method not only provides a new entry point to calculus but also deepens our understanding of the underlying algebraic structure of smooth functions. 1. Introduction Suppose we have a function $f$ defined on an open interval. We postulate that when the input is shifted by a small amount $\Delta x$, the value of $f$ can be expressed as a series: $$ f(x+\Delta x) = A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots. $$ Here, the coefficients $A_0, A_1, A_2, \dots$ represent the contributions from successive orders of the infinitesimally small increment $\Delta x$. Our objective is to determine these coefficients using only elementary algebra and limit operations. We will show that, under the assumption that the power series converges to $f(x+\Delta x)$ for $ \Delta x $ sufficiently small, the coefficients are given by: $$ A_0 = f(x),\quad A_1 = f&#39;(x),\quad A_2 = \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2!},\quad A_3 = \frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!},\quad \dots, $$ so that the series becomes $$ \boxed{f(x+\Delta x) = f(x) + f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x + \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2!}\,(\Delta x)^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.} $$ 2. Infinitesimal Increments and Series Expansions 2.1 Orders of Infinitesimals First-Order Terms ($\Delta x$)These terms are the dominant contributors when $\Delta x$ is very small. Higher-Order Terms ($(\Delta x)^2, (\Delta x)^3, \dots$)These contributions diminish more rapidly as $\Delta x$ tends to zero. In our approach, we “peel off” the series one term at a time to reveal the algebraic pattern. Our aim is to make this pattern as visible as possible. 3. The Complete Proof from First Principles Assume that for an infinitely small increment $\Delta x$, the function $f$ can be expressed as $$ f(x+\Delta x)= A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots. $$ We now proceed step by step to determine the coefficients $A_0, A_1, A_2, \dots$ by elementary algebra and taking limits. 3.1 Determination of $A_0$: The Zeroth-Order Term Set $\Delta x = 0$: $$ f(x+0)= A_0 + A_1\cdot 0 + A_2\cdot 0^2 + A_3\cdot 0^3 + \cdots = A_0. $$ Since $f(x+0) = f(x)$, it follows directly that $$ \boxed{A_0 = f(x)}. $$ 3.2 Determination of $A_1$: The First-Order Term Subtract the constant term from the expansion: $$ f(x+\Delta x)-f(x) = A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots. $$ Divide by $\Delta x$ (with $\Delta x \neq 0$): $$ \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} = A_1 + A_2\,\Delta x + A_3\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots. $$ Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ (and noting that every term with a factor of $\Delta x$ or higher becomes negligible), we obtain: $$ \lim_{\Delta x\to0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} = A_1. $$ By the definition of the derivative, this limit is $f’(x)$. Thus, $$ \boxed{A_1 = f&#39;(x)}. $$ 3.3 Determination of $A_2$: The Second-Order Term Subtract the zeroth- and first-order contributions: $$ f(x+\Delta x) - f(x) - f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x = A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots. $$ Divide by $(\Delta x)^2$: $$ \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x) - f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x}{(\Delta x)^2} = A_2 + A_3\,\Delta x + A_4\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots. $$ Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ leaves only the term $A_2$: $$ \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)-f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x}{(\Delta x)^2} = A_2. $$ A straightforward computation shows that this limit equals $\frac{f’‘(x)}{2}$. Therefore, $$ \boxed{A_2 = \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2!}}. $$ 3.4 Determination of $A_3$ and the General Pattern Subtract the contributions up to second order: $$ f(x+\Delta x) - f(x) - f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x - \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2}(\Delta x)^2 = A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + A_4\,(\Delta x)^4 + \cdots. $$ Divide by $(\Delta x)^3$: $$ \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x) - f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x - \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2}(\Delta x)^2}{(\Delta x)^3} = A_3 + A_4\,\Delta x + \cdots. $$ Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ isolates $A_3$: $$ \boxed{A_3 = \frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}}. $$ Repeating this process reveals the general pattern: $$ \boxed{A_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!} \quad \text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots.} $$ Thus, the series expansion is exactly $$ \boxed{f(x+\Delta x) = f(x) + f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x + \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2!}\,(\Delta x)^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.} $$ 4. Motivation and Benefits of This Approach 4.1 An Alternative Entry Point to Calculus This work is intended to provide another entry point into calculus—one that starts with the idea of expressing a function as a sum of contributions corresponding to different orders of an infinitely small change. Rather than first introducing limits, slopes, and integration in their traditional order, we begin with a purely algebraic perspective that exposes the underlying pattern in a function’s behavior. 4.2 Emphasis on Algebraic Patterns By focusing on the algebraic process of “peeling off” the constant term, then the term proportional to $\Delta x$, then $(\Delta x)^2$, and so on, we reveal a clear and visible pattern. This pattern shows that: The first term is simply the value of the function. The next term (once divided by $\Delta x$ and in the limit) yields the first derivative. Continuing in this fashion leads to the higher-order derivatives, each scaled by the corresponding factorial. This pattern is central to the Taylor series expansion and, by presenting it in an elementary way, we make the emergence of these ideas transparent. 4.3 Benefits for First Principles Conceptual Clarity:Students can see that the structure of a smooth function is built up from layers of algebraic contributions—each corresponding to a higher order of an infinitesimal change. This makes the derivation self-contained and logically straightforward. Early Exposure:By introducing these ideas at the very start of calculus, learners gain an intuitive grasp of how local behavior (expressed through these algebraic patterns) gives rise to the powerful techniques later used in analysis and approximation. Foundation for Further Study:This approach lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of more advanced topics. Even when higher-level concepts such as integration or complex analysis are introduced later, the fundamental idea of decomposing a function into orders of smallness remains central. 5. Conclusion We have shown, by an elementary algebraic method, that if a function $f$ can be represented by a power series $$ f(x+\Delta x) = A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots, $$ then the coefficients must be given by $$ A_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}\quad \text{for } n=0,1,2,\dots, $$ so that the expansion becomes $$ \boxed{f(x+\Delta x) = f(x) + f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x + \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2!}\,(\Delta x)^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.} $$ This work provides a new, elementary entry point to calculus by focusing on the visible algebraic pattern of orders of infinitesimals. It emphasizes that the Taylor series is not merely an approximation tool used later in calculus but is in fact a natural consequence of the structure of functions when analyzed from first principles.

Thus, $$ \boxed{A_1 = f&#39;(x)}. $$ 3.3 Determination of $A_2$: The Second-Order Term Subtract the zeroth- and first-order contributions: $$ f(x+\Delta x) - f(x) - f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x = A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots. $$ Divide by $(\Delta x)^2$: $$ \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x) - f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x}{(\Delta x)^2} = A_2 + A_3\,\Delta x + A_4\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots. $$ Taking the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$ leaves only the term $A_2$: $$ \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)-f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x}{(\Delta x)^2} = A_2. $$ A straightforward computation shows that this limit equals $\frac{f’‘(x)}{2}$.

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>In many traditional calculus courses, topics such as limits, derivatives, and integrals are introduced in a sequence that often postpones the discussion of series expansions (and, in particular, the Taylor series) until later. In contrast, the approach presented here starts at the very beginning by considering the effect of an infinitesimally small change in the input on the output of a function. Our goal is to demonstrate, through purely algebraic manipulations and limit processes, that a function can be decomposed into contributions of successive orders of smallness.</p>

<p>By “peeling off” the contributions term‐by‐term, we uncover a clear and visible pattern that leads directly to the standard Taylor series expansion. This method not only provides a new entry point to calculus but also deepens our understanding of the underlying algebraic structure of smooth functions.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Suppose we have a function <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math_f-8fa14cdd-5289daa8-f7f6-411e-8a48-2fe0fd508f27.svg" alt="f" class="math-svg" /></span> defined on an open interval. We postulate that when the input is shifted by a small amount <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math__Delta_x-b56546a8-9aba49ea-c6d9-4332-8cd7-ec2a757c4db0.svg" alt="\Delta x" class="math-svg" /></span>, the value of <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math_f-8fa14cdd-5289daa8-f7f6-411e-8a48-2fe0fd508f27.svg" alt="f" class="math-svg" /></span> can be expressed as a series:</p>

<h2 id="4-motivation-and-benefits-of-this-approach">4. Motivation and Benefits of This Approach</h2>

<h3 id="41-an-alternative-entry-point-to-calculus">4.1 An Alternative Entry Point to Calculus</h3>

<p>This work is intended to provide another entry point into calculus—one that starts with the idea of expressing a function as a sum of contributions corresponding to different orders of an infinitely small change. Rather than first introducing limits, slopes, and integration in their traditional order, we begin with a purely algebraic perspective that exposes the underlying pattern in a function’s behavior.</p>

<h3 id="42-emphasis-on-algebraic-patterns">4.2 Emphasis on Algebraic Patterns</h3>

<p>By focusing on the algebraic process of “peeling off” the constant term, then the term proportional to <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math__Delta_x-b56546a8-9aba49ea-c6d9-4332-8cd7-ec2a757c4db0.svg" alt="\Delta x" class="math-svg" /></span>, then <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math___Delta_x__2-73c3edf7-bca02f2a-e001-4094-ac0f-4c88491051a5.svg" alt="(\Delta x)^2" class="math-svg" /></span>, and so on, we reveal a clear and visible pattern. This pattern shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first term is simply the value of the function.</li>
  <li>The next term (once divided by <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math__Delta_x-b56546a8-9aba49ea-c6d9-4332-8cd7-ec2a757c4db0.svg" alt="\Delta x" class="math-svg" /></span> and in the limit) yields the first derivative.</li>
  <li>Continuing in this fashion leads to the higher-order derivatives, each scaled by the corresponding factorial.</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern is central to the Taylor series expansion and, by presenting it in an elementary way, we make the emergence of these ideas transparent.</p>

<h3 id="43-benefits-for-first-principles">4.3 Benefits for First Principles</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Conceptual Clarity:Students can see that the structure of a smooth function is built up from layers of algebraic contributions—each corresponding to a higher order of an infinitesimal change. This makes the derivation self-contained and logically straightforward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early Exposure:By introducing these ideas at the very start of calculus, learners gain an intuitive grasp of how local behavior (expressed through these algebraic patterns) gives rise to the powerful techniques later used in analysis and approximation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foundation for Further Study:This approach lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of more advanced topics. Even when higher-level concepts such as integration or complex analysis are introduced later, the fundamental idea of decomposing a function into orders of smallness remains central.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have shown, by an elementary algebraic method, that if a function <span class="math-inline"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math_f-8fa14cdd-5289daa8-f7f6-411e-8a48-2fe0fd508f27.svg" alt="f" class="math-svg" /></span> can be represented by a power series</p>

<p>then the coefficients must be given by</p>

<div class="math-block"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math_A_n____frac_f___n___-f98180af-4d62e593-03b7-42c5-be75-215b30886b1d.svg" alt="A_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}\quad \text{for } n=0,1,2,\dots," class="math-svg" /></div>

<p>so that the expansion becomes</p>

<div class="math-block"><img src="/assets/svg/math/mathematics/calculus/integration/foundations/part6-a/math__boxed_f_x__Delta_x_-4cc27ceb-2e56a91b-b102-43f0-b3ce-b2dbbd487c24.svg" alt="\boxed{f(x+\Delta x) = f(x) + f&#39;(x)\,\Delta x + \frac{f&#39;&#39;(x)}{2!}\,(\Delta x)^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.}" class="math-svg" /></div>

<p>This work provides a new, elementary entry point to calculus by focusing on the visible algebraic pattern of orders of infinitesimals. It emphasizes that the Taylor series is not merely an approximation tool used later in calculus but is in fact a natural consequence of the structure of functions when analyzed from first principles.</p>
