Welcome to "Calculus from First Principles." My name is Vinit K S., and I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in both computer science and mathematics.

I have a Master of Engineering in Computer Science from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. During my studies, I focused on understanding mathematical concepts and how they can be applied to software development. My thesis on Brain-Computer Interfaces was an attempt to explore complex problems and find practical solutions.

In my professional journey, I've worked on software development projects, including contributions to IDE frameworks like IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code. I've also had the opportunity to contribute to code analysis tools and network protocols, which have deepened my understanding of how software systems work.

This blog is a way for me to share some of what I've learned about calculus. Here, I aim to break down key concepts, from limits and derivatives to integrals and series, using simple examples and practical applications.

I invite you to join me in exploring the foundational concepts of calculus, starting from the basics.
